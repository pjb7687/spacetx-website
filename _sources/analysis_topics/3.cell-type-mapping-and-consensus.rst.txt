Cell Type Mapping and Combined Results
=======================================

- Annotation of VISp area for mapping [Brian L / Christoffer]

  Cell locations were visualized in Napari https://napari.org and manually 
  annotated to contain the largest possible area of primary visual cortex. 
  Layers were manually annotated based on cell density and gene expression.
