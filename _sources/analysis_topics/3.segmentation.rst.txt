Cell Segmentation
=======================================

Cell segmentation associates mRNA spot locations with individual cells, creating transcriptomic profiles that make up the cell-by-gene table.

**Cell Segmentation Methods I:**

Basic cell segmentation uses image data such as DAPI or PolyA images to define a spatial region for each cell. 

In the SpaceTx project, we developed DAPI-based nuclear segmentation method that was subsequently used for augmented cell segmentation methods described below. 

- Oleh's approach: feature based
- Luca's approach: learning based 


**Cell Segmentation Methods II:**

Augmented Cell Segmentation methods use additional information (beyond image data) to associate mRNA spot locations with individual cells [Viktor, Dimitris, others?] 



SpaceTx segmentation approach:

1. Segmentation of DAPI images to define nuclei
2. Incorporate DAPI segmentation, mRNA spot tables and cluster annotations in Baysor alogrithm to create cell-by-gene tables. 
3. Create alternative segmentation using pciSeq to revise mRNA spot assignments
